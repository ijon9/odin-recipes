    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while
         simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special.
